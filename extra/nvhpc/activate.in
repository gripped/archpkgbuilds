# Run `source /opt/nvidia/hpc_sdk/activate` to activate the NVIDIA HPC SDK
# in your current shell environment.
# WARNING: nvc, nvc++, and nvfortran will become the default compilers for
# C, C++, and Fortran in that environment, which may not be always wanted.
# This will also override communication libraries (nccl and openmpi) from
# Arch packages with the versions bundled in the SDK.
