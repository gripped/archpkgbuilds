- nvhpc is a meta-package providing the NVIDIA HPC SDK. The cuda, math_libs and
  profilers components are unbundled and provided by the common cuda and
  cuda-tools packages. The communication libraries and compilers are split into
  their own nvhpc-comm-libs and nvhpc-compilers packages that can be used
  separately from the whole SDK.
