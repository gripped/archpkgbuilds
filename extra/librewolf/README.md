# LibreWolf

## Custom `pkgver` setup

Despite what the [Firefox release page is showing](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/releases/), Firefox "round" releases do not actually contain a trailing `.0` as a third digit. For instance, the `154.0.0` release shown on the website actually doesn't exists, the actual matching upstream version / tag is `154.0` (see the [corresponding update for our Firefox package](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/firefox/-/commit/635083cfc15fcb3b56bc7fb537742805afaf4711)). Non "round" release are actually using the expected scheme though (for instance, `154.0.1`).

The LibreWolf version scheme is `$Firefox_version-LibreWolf_release`. For instance, for the first release of LibreWolf based on the `154.0` Firefox version, the matching LibreWolf version will be `154.0_1` (actually `154.0-1` but we have to replace the hyphen by an underscore to produce a valid `pkgver`). Consequently, the second LibreWolf release based on the `154.0.1` Firefox release will be `154.0.1_2`.

Given Firefox's arguable version scheme for "round" releses, that unfortunately causes issues in term of version comparison, since whatever is after the underscore will always take the precedent. For instance, `154.0_2` (second LibreWolf release based on the `154.0` Firefox version) is seen as newer than `154.0.1_1` (first LibreWolf release based on the `154.0.1` Firefox version):

```bash
$ vercmp 154.0_2 154.0.1_1
1
```

This can result in unexpected version comparison issue, eventually forcing the implementation (or the increment) of an epoch:

```
"warning: librewolf: local (154.0_2-1) is newer than extra-testing (154.0.1_2-1)"
```

To work around this issue, we therefore have to add the "missing" trailing `.0` for round releases, in order to ensure a coherent version comparison logic. As such, the `155.0_1` LibreWolf version should instead be `155.0.0_1` as a `pkgver` in our package for instance.  
The PKGBUILD "re-computes" the `pkgver` to match the actual upstream version scheme in a custom `_pkgver` variable automatically, which is used in the source array.

This also act as safeguard: A `pkgver` missing the required trailing `.0` third digit for "round" releases (e.g. `155.0_1`) will result in a wrong `_pkgver` variable, preventing sources from being downloaded. If you face non-existing sources when trying to fetch them, this is most likely the issue.  
**Do not try** to fix it directly in the source array, or you will likely expose the package update to the above version comparison problem. Instead, just add a trailing `.0` as a third digit for "round" release (e.g. `155.0.0_1`).

For extra safety, there's also a `pkgver()` function ensuring that the `pkgver` contains a trailing `.0` third digit for "round" releases.

The `.nvchecker.toml` configuration has also been updated to reflect this custom `pkgver` setup. Note that it relies on the nvchecker `jq` source so you need to have the `python-jq` package installed (optional dependency for `nvchecker`).
